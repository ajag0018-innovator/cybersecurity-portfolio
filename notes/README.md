# Notes
This section contains my study notes, frameworks and research references.

It includes:
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings and blue team strategies  
- Common log analysis patterns  
- Networking and protocol essentials  
- Cheat sheets for incident response tools and commands  

I update this section regularly as I progress through new certifications, labs and learning modules.
