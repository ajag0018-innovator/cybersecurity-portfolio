# About Me
Hi there! I’m an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst passionate about threat detection, incident response and defensive security operations.
This portfolio documents my learning journey, hands-on projects and technical experiments as I develop the practical skills needed to thrive in a SOC and beyond.

I believe in continuous learning, ethical security practices and building systems that make the digital world safer.
