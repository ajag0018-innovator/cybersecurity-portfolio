# Projects
This section showcases my cybersecurity projects and practical exercises.

Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in areas such as:
- Security monitoring and incident response  
- SIEM configuration and alert analysis  
- Threat hunting and malware investigation  
- Network and endpoint defense  
- Python scripting and automation  

Each project folder includes:
- A brief `README.md` explaining the project  
- Supporting files (scripts, configs, or screenshots)  
- A short reflection on what I learned
